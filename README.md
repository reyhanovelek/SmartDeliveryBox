Smart delivery box system using Java Generics

📦 Assignment: “The Smart Delivery Box” – Java Generics & GitHub Practice

👩‍💻 Theme:

You’re building a smart delivery system for an e-commerce company. The system uses a Box<T> class to store items of any type: electronics, groceries, clothes, or even documents! Your job is to model this using Java Generics, and share your work via GitHub.

📝 Tasks:

1. GitHub Setup (5 points)
   Create a new public GitHub repository named: SmartDeliveryBox-YourName.
   Add a README.md describing your project in a few lines.
   Push your code and update your README as needed.
2. Create a Generic Class (10 points)
   Create a class called SmartBox<T> that can hold any object type.
   Add methods:
   void addItem(T item)
   T getItem()
3. Model Real-life Items (10 points)
   Create at least two item classes (e.g., Document, Electronic).
   Use SmartBox<Document> and SmartBox<Electronic> in a test class.
4. Wildcard Practice (5 points)
   Create a method that accepts any SmartBox<? extends Object> and prints out the item.
5. Commit History (5 points)
   Make at least 3 commits:
   Commit 1: Initial setup
   Commit 2: Added SmartBox and item classes
   Commit 3: Added test code and final touches
 
   📤 Submission Instructions:

   Submit the link to your GitHub repository via your LMS/email.

   💡 Tips:

   You can use IntelliJ, Eclipse, or any IDE you prefer.
   Keep it simple — focus on getting the generics working.
   Add comments to your code to explain what each part does.
